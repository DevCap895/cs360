Summary of Requirements and Goals
The Weight Tracker App was created to help users log and monitor their weight over time, supporting personal health and fitness goals. It allows users to track daily weight, view past entries, and receive optional SMS reminders to stay consistent. By focusing on data logging and accessibility, the app fulfills the need for a simple yet effective health-tracking tool.

Screens and Features Supporting User Needs
The app includes a login screen for secure access, a main screen to view and manage weight logs, and an SMS permission screen for enabling notifications. The UI design prioritized user-friendliness with clear labels, touch-friendly layouts, and responsive elements for both tech-savvy and occasional users. These design choices ensured a successful and user-centered experience.

Approach to App Development
I developed the app iteratively, starting with the SQLite database for persistent data storage and implementing core features like user authentication and CRUD operations. Modular coding, dynamic layouts, and Android tools like RecyclerView ensured efficiency. This structured approach provided scalability and can be applied to future projects.

Testing Process
I tested the app using unit tests for individual components and manual tests for real-world use cases. This process revealed issues like database duplication and improved SMS permission handling, ensuring the app’s reliability. Testing was crucial in delivering a functional, user-ready product.

Overcoming Challenges
Key challenges included designing a scalable database schema and integrating the backend with the UI. I used primary keys and prepared statements to manage unique entries and dynamically connected database changes to the RecyclerView. These strategies resolved technical obstacles and delivered a polished app.

Demonstrating Knowledge and Skill
Integrating SQLite with the app’s UI was a highlight. By designing a robust database schema and implementing CRUD operations, I ensured data persistence and dynamic updates to the RecyclerView. This integration demonstrated my technical skills and ability to create a reliable, user-focused app.
